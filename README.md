Banking System
This is a simple Banking System developed in C++ by Group N as part of the Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) coursework at JKUAT, BBIT 2.1. The project demonstrates core OOP principles and functionalities, providing a foundation for real-world banking software.

Features
Account Creation

Allows users to create a bank account by entering relevant details such as name, account number, and initial deposit.
Information Retrieval

Retrieves and displays account details, including the balance and account holder's name.
Withdraw Funds

Enables users to withdraw a specified amount from their account (with error handling for insufficient funds).
Deposit Funds

Allows users to deposit a specified amount into their account.
File I/O

Saves account details to a file for persistence and retrieves them for future sessions.
Exception Handling

Handles invalid inputs, file errors, and other potential issues gracefully.
Menu/Command-Line Interface

A user-friendly menu-based interface to interact with the system via command-line.
Object-Oriented Principles Demonstrated
This project implements the following OOP concepts:

Encapsulation: Private and public access modifiers are used to secure data.
Inheritance: Base and derived classes are implemented for shared functionality.
Polymorphism: Virtual functions enable method overriding for flexibility.
Abstraction: Abstract classes and interfaces are used where applicable.
File I/O: File operations using fstream to store and retrieve data.
Exception Handling: Ensures smooth execution with try-catch blocks for errors.
Project Requirements
Programming Language: C++ (C++11 or higher)
Compiler: GCC, Visual Studio, Code::Blocks, or any C++-supported IDE
Standard Libraries: <iostream>, <fstream>, <string>, <vector>, <exception>

Compilation Instructions for the Banking System Project
To compile and run the Banking System project, follow these steps:

Step 1: Install a C++ Compiler
Ensure you have a C++ compiler installed on your system. Below are some common options:

Linux/Mac: GCC (GNU Compiler Collection)
Install using:
bash
Copy code
sudo apt update
sudo apt install g++
Windows: Use MinGW or an IDE like Code::Blocks/Visual Studio.
Step 2: Clone the Repository
If the project is hosted on GitHub, clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/Saint-St/THE-BANK.git
cd banking-system
Step 3: Compile the Code
Single Source File: If all the code is in a single file (e.g., banking_system.cpp), compile it with:

bash
Copy code
g++ -std=c++11 banking_system.cpp -o banking_system
Multiple Files: If the project contains multiple .cpp and .h files:

bash
Copy code
g++ -std=c++11 *.cpp -o banking_system
*.cpp ensures all C++ source files in the directory are compiled.
Adjust filenames if the project structure differs.
Step 4: Run the Program
After compilation, execute the program using:

bash
Copy code
./banking_system
For Windows:

cmd
Copy code
banking_system.exe
Step 5: Debugging or Cleaning
If you encounter compilation errors, ensure all header files and source files are in the same directory.
Clean compiled files with:
bash
Copy code
rm banking_system  # Linux/Mac
del banking_system.exe  # Windows
Optional: Use an IDE
Code::Blocks: Create a new project, add source and header files, and build/run.
Visual Studio: Open a new project, add .cpp and .h files, and compile/run.
