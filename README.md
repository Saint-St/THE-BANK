# 🏦 Banking System

A **simple Banking System** developed in **C++** by **grop 1-Group N** as part of the Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) coursework at **JKUAT**, BBIT 2.1. This project showcases key OOP principles while providing basic banking functionalities, serving as a foundation for real-world banking software.

## ✨ Features

### 📂 **Account Creation**
- Users can create a bank account by entering details like **name**, **account number**, and **initial deposit**.

### 🔍 **Information Retrieval**
- Retrieve and display account details, such as **balance** and **account holder's name**.

### 💵 **Withdraw Funds**
- Withdraw a specified amount from an account with error handling for **insufficient funds**.

### 💰 **Deposit Funds**
- Deposit a specified amount into a bank account.

### 💾 **File I/O**
- Save and retrieve account details to/from a file for **data persistence**.

### ⚠️ **Exception Handling**
- Handle invalid inputs, file errors, and other potential issues with **graceful error handling**.

### 📋 **Menu/Command-Line Interface**
- A **user-friendly menu-based CLI** to interact with the system.

## 📚 Object-Oriented Principles Demonstrated

This project implements core **OOP principles**, including:

- **Encapsulation**: Use of private and public access modifiers for secure data handling.
- **Inheritance**: Implementation of base and derived classes for shared functionality.
- **Polymorphism**: Use of virtual functions for method overriding.
- **Abstraction**: Use of abstract classes and interfaces where applicable.
- **File I/O**: Storing and retrieving data using `fstream`.
- **Exception Handling**: Smooth execution with `try-catch` blocks for errors.

## 🛠️ Project Requirements

- **Programming Language**: C++ (C++11 or higher)
- **Compiler**: GCC, Visual Studio, Code::Blocks, or any C++-supported IDE
- **Standard Libraries**: `<iostream>`, `<fstream>`, `<string>`, `<vector>`, `<exception>`
